            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                It all began with a simple idea: to turn waste into wonder. Founded by a group of passionate artists and eco-enthusiasts, our platform emerged as a bridge between sustainable creativity and conscious consumerism. Today, we continue to celebrate the power of transformation and ingenuity.

            <h2>How we work</h2>
            <p>
                When you donate a product to the site, it goes through several stages
                First, a representative from the company arrives to receive the product from you and give you a price according to the product, then he goes to the inspection workshop 
                If you would like us to repair it and return it to you, the product will be beautified and repaired and the product will be priced based on the extent of the damage
                Otherwise, the product is sent to the warehouse to be recycled and created from it or repaired and sold.
